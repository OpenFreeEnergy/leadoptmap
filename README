What's here:

- prototype directory:

Mobley lab prototype implementation of the clustering tools, currently being updated. As of 6/11/12, only the MCSS_tool.py, toolkit for obtaining MCSS scores, is here.

Update 6/12/12:

Usage of the prototype version (currently uses several separate tools):

1 use getMCSS_ScoreMatrix_Unstrict.py and getMCSS_ScoreMatrix.py to get the MCSS score matrix using two different approaches to scoring similarity (relating to ring checking)

2 use hierarchical_cluster.py to hierarchical clusters -- structural clusters of molecules

3 use get_cluster_list_and_path.py to get a list of clusters (converts the dictionary output by #2 to a list of clusters and also gets paths of mol2 files on disk)

4 use calculation_planning.py to plan the calculation and get the final map (also calls on tool for cycle detection)

What's coming:
- test sets: SAMPL3, trypsin, and small molecule sets used for testing the calculation planning
